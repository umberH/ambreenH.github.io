# Past Paths
I was born and raised in Pakistan, a naturally rich soil of South Asia. It is home to diverse range of ethicic groups and is a cradle of th eworlld's poldest civilizations including Indus valley Civilizations. 
We boost the second highest mountain in the world, K2, located in the karakoram Range.  From the sno-capped peaks to the north to the lucj plains of Pinjab and the ragged deserts of Sindh and Balochistan, Pakistan's landscape is incredibbly diverse. The variety of the ecosystms supports a wide range of wildlife and offer numerous oppportunities for adventure tourism. Pakistan also has the Largest continous irrigation system in the world.
